# odin-recipes
This small, simple recipe website is an exercise early in The Odin Project's curriculum.

Utilized a GitHub repository
    -Used best practices for commit messages
    -Atomic commits
    -Git from command line
    -Cloning repository to local machine using SSH
    *Probably pushed too many times instead of multiple staging cycles before big pushes, will adjust workflow in future projects

Employed newly learned HTML elements
    -Ordered and unordered lists
    -Links
    -Images
    -Headings

Used best practices for directory management
    -index.html as home page
    -folders for images and recipe pages

Created a recipe page template to increase effeciency
    odin-recipes/recipes/recipe-template.html

Meant for educational purposes. All images and recipes sourced from allrecipes.com
